I teach at Mars University and have worked for Momcorp on several occasions, but I spend most of my time inventing ingenious devices and sending the Planet Express delivery crew on missions. I'm not sure exactly what I'm a professor of, but I teach the same thing I teach every semester, *The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields*. I made up the title so no student would dare take it.
