## Soft condensed matter

Some examples of soft matter and their microscopic structure
1. Liquid crystals: (uncooked) spaghetti 
2. Polymers: cooked spaghetti
3. Colloids: ping-pong balls

Rheological properties: half-solid, half-liquid

Some numerical/theoretical methods I have used: pseudo-spectral methods, stochastic partial differential equations, lattice Boltzmann, renormalization group, and molecular dynamics.

## Non-equilibrium statistical physics

**Equilibrium systems:**
Boltzmann distribution and time reversal symmetry in steady state.
Some examples: passive soft matter like liquid crystals, emulsions, colloids, _etc._

**Non-equilibrium systems:** 
unBoltzmann distribution and broken time reversal symmetry in steady state.
Examples: biological soft matter like living tissues, sub-cellular materials, _etc._

Current research interest: time reversal symmetry breaking in statistical field theory.
