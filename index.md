## Theory and simulations of soft condensed matter

Current research interests: time reversal symmetry breaking in statistical field theory, liquid crystals, cell motility, active glass and jamming.
Some numerical/theoretical methods I have used: stochastic partial differential equations, lattice Boltzmann, renormalization group, and molecular dynamics.
