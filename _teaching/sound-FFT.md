Do you play a musical instrument? do you want to refresh your Python? do you want to learn Fourier transform? Then this course will teach you all of the above.

### Introduction

This course will introduce you to the basic principles of signal analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Signal analysis covers everything from audio to electrical signal with applications to image processing, sound engineering, telecommunications, etc. In this course we will focus specifically on audio signal/sound wave, which one can easily produce from a musical intrument or from singing a tune. We will then analyse this audio signal using a powerful mathematical algorithm, called Fast Fourier Transform or FFT, which will allow us to decompose the audio signal in terms of its constituent frequencies.
