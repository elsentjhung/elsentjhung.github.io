__Current teaching at the Open University (Academic Year 2022/2023):__

- Level 1: Essential Mathematics 1. This module covers basics calculus and linear algebra.

- Level 3: Fluid Mechanics and Mathematical Methods. This module covers ODE, PDE, Fourier series, and fluid mechanics.

- Level 3: Computational Applied Mathematical Methods. This module covers optimization, fast Fourier transform and solving differential equations numerically.

__Previous teaching at Durham University (Academic Year 2020/2021):__

- Level 3: Maths Workshop - integral transform. I taught Fourier transform and Laplace transform. Lecture notes can be downloaded <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elsentjhung/elsentjhung.github.io/master/_files/integral-transform.pdf">here</a>. (notes will be periodically updated).

- Level 3: Computing Projects. I supervised computational condensed matter projects: hard spheres crystallization, band structure of semiconductors, electron tunelling and Ising model.

- Level 1: Foundations of Physics Tutorials. I gave tutorials in classical mechanics, waves, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity.
