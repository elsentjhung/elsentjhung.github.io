Currently I am teaching (at Durham University Year 2020/2021):

- Level 3: Maths Workshop - integral transform. Lecture notes [here] (notes will be periodically updated)

The bottom left figure shows the sound wave _P(t)_ from the middle A from the piano. 
The bottom right figure shows its Fourier transform (modulus squared)  _|P(ω)|<sup>2</sup>_ as a function of angular frequency _ω_ (in units of Hz). 
The Fourier transform  _|P(ω)|<sup>2</sup>_ tells us the frequency spectrum of this particular piano note. 
_|P(ω)|<sup>2</sup>_ shows a peak at _ω ≃ 440Hz_. 
This corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the middle A indeed. 
However, _|P(ω)|<sup>2</sup>_ also shows several other peaks at _ω ≃ 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, 1760 Hz_ and so
on. 
The peak at _ω ≃ 880Hz_ corresponds to the note of high A. 
The peak at _ω ≃ 1320 Hz_ corresponds to the note of high E. 
So the middle A note contains a small percentage of E note. 
Bach _et al._ discovered that when note A and note E are played together, they sound nice. 
This is called harmony in music theory.

- Level 3: Computing Projects - hard spheres crystallization, band structure of semiconductors, and Ising model

- Level 1: Foundations of Physics Tutorials
