## Principle of Least Action

I will be talking about the principle of least action in the upcoming Maths Week Scotland.

What is the quickest route to go from A to B? Most often it is just a straight line. However, when you are on a terrain, with different elevation, relative to the sea level, the quickest route might not be a straight line anymore.â€¯ The mathematics of variational calculus allows us to calculate this optimal path. It turns out that electrons and light also follow the most optimal path to go from A to B. This is called the principle of least action, which forms the foundation of most modern physics.
