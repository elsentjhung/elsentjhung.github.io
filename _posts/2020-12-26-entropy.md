In this blog post we will discuss how to calculate entropy production in active field theories, taking into account of temporal discretization and Ito/Stratonovich issues.

## Entropy production

Let us consider some trajectory $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ from time $t = t_i$ to $t = t_f$. The rate of entropy production $\mathcal{S}$ is defined to be the logarithm of the ratio of forward probability to the backwards probability:

$$ \mathcal{S} = \lim_{(t_f-t_i)\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{t_f-t_i} \left<\ln\left(\frac{P_F[\phi]}{P_B[\phi]}\right)\right> $$

where $P_F[\phi]$ is the probability functional of obtaining a particular trajectory $ \left\{\phi(\mathbf{r},t)|t\in[t_i,t_f]\right\} $
and $P_B[\phi]$ is the probability functional of obtaining the same trajectory going backwards in time (see image below). 
_In another word, entropy production is a measure of time-irreversibility_.

The angle brackets above $ \left<\dots\right>" $ indicates averaging over all noise realizations.

## Entropy production for active model B

Active model B is a model for phase separation in active matter, which is a derivative of the active model B+ (see [previous post]). 
The active model B dynamics is given by:

$$ \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf{J}^{d} + \boldsymbol{\Lambda}\right) = 0 $$

$\mathbf{J}_d$ is the deterministic current and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and delta function correlation:

$$ \left<\Lambda_\alpha(\mathbf{r},t)\Lambda_\beta(\mathbf{r}',t')\right> = 2D\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\delta(t-t') $$

The deterministic current is given by:

$$ \mathbf{J}_{d} = -\nabla\underbrace{\left(\frac{\delta F}{\delta\phi} + \lambda|\nabla\phi|^{2}\right)}_{\mu} $$

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential, which consists of the passive/equilibrium part: $\delta F/\delta\phi$ and the active part: $\lambda|\nabla\phi|^2$
The rate of entropy production for this dynamics can be shown to be given by ([Nardini, Fodor, Tjhung, van Wijland, Tailleur, Cates, _PRX_, (2017)]):

$$ \begin{align}
\mathcal{S} & =\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{0}^{\tau}dt\,\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}\circ\mu\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\tau}\sum_{t}\Delta t\frac{\phi_{t+\Delta t}-\phi_{t-\Delta t}}{2\Delta t}\mu_{t},\nonumber
\end{align}" $$

where the time integral is interpreted as Stratonovich. _ϕ<sub>t</sub>_ is the density field at time _t_ and _μ<sub>t</sub>_ is the chemical potential at time _t_. The reason for the Strotonovich choice is follows:

When we are computing entropy production, basically, we are comparing the trajectory going forward in time and the trajectory going backwards in time.

Now the time is discretized into _t = 0, dt, 2dt, 3dt, …_. That means the trajectory is also split into segments. 
The way we split the trajectory is done in the Stratonovich way. 
That means the value of _ϕ_ at time _t_ means the value of _ϕ_ mid-point of _[t, t+dt]_. i.e. _ϕ(__r__,t+dt/2)_. 
If we discretize the trajectory in `Ito’ way, the time-reversed of that trajectory is not identical (see drawing below).

However, when we perform the simulations, we do it in `Ito’ way. i.e. we start from _ϕ(__r__,0)_, then we update the time to get _ϕ(__r__,0), ϕ(__r__,dt), ϕ(__r__,2dt), ϕ(__r__,3dt), ..._.
