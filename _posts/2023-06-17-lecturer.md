I would like to advertise a 5-year fixed term position in Applied Mathematics (with focus on Statistical Physics/Fluid Dynamics/Soft Matter) at the Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. 

This is a teaching + research position. The candidate will be expected to build their own teaching portfolio and lead an independent research programme, which complements the research activities at the School of Mathematics and Statistics. 
 
## Teaching

A high percentage of our students are part-time students, mature students, students with disabilities, caring responsibilities, and other circumstances. As such, there is no formal face-to-face lectures, but instead, academics are expected to produce high quality course books, which are then sent out to students.  A pdf example of a unit/chapter of a course book can be found in:

Students will also attend either face-to-face tutorials (usually at major cities across the UK) or online tutorials in the evenings/weekends. Note that as a central academic, you are not required to give tutorials, however you may apply to become a tutor (and you will get paid extra on a separate contract).
 
## Research

Candidate will be expected to develop their own independent research programme, which complements the research activities at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, see here:
<https://www.open.ac.uk/stem/mathematics-and-statistics/research/research-groups/applied-mathematics-and-theoretical-physics>

The candidate will also receive excellent mentorship and support from the school to apply for an external funding to further develop their research leadership. Recently, the school has had few successes in securing external grants (despite its relatively small size), including 2 EPSRC Research Fellowships, several EPSRC and LMS grants. Some of our staff are also members of the Strategic Advisory Team for the UKRI. 
 
## Outreach

The academic workload for a lecturer is similar to other UK universities, i.e. 1/3 teaching, 1/3 research, and 1/3 other things. The `other thingsâ€™ may include administration, writing grants, and contributing to outreach activities. The OU has a long history of partnership with the BBC, see full list of portfolio here:
<https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/open-university>

Normally, you will work together with the media team to deliver a high quality video/radio content.
