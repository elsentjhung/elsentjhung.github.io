I am interested in exploring the non-equilibrium nature of Active Matter systems. 

Active matter consists of a large number of “active” particles, each of which is capable of consuming energy locally, causing them to move with deterministic or stochastic rules that break one of the usual symmetries of mechanics (time-reversal symmetry). Examples of active matter are commonplace in biology: bird flocks, bacteria colonies, tumour growth, self-organising bio-polymers etc.

As a result of this constant injection and dissipation of energy at the microscopic level, these systems are permanently driven away from equilibrium, where many familiar principles of statistical physics don’t apply. Recent progresses have enabled us to capture the collective behaviours of many complex biological systems in terms of simpler models, making it easier to trace the non-equilibrium nature of such systems.


In particular, I am primarily interested in exploring how the emergent features, displayed when large numbers of active particles interact together, compare and contrast with similar features in other types of non-equilibrium systems. One extensively studied system is the reaction-diffusion processes, where reaction transforms one substance to another locally and diffusion causes the substances to spread out. Another example is the so called ‘absorbing state’ systems in which particle motion can cease altogether if the system organises itself in a particular way (for instance so that all particles are outside each others range of interaction). In addition, systems can be driven out of equilibrium by forces at the boundary (e.g. shear flow) as opposed to the local activity.
