Current research interests: time reversal symmetry breaking in statistical field theory, active droplets, chiral liquid crystals, glasses, _etc_.

I use lattice Boltzmann simulation for fluid dynamics.

## Time reversal symmetry breaking

In statistical physics we often say this system is in equilibrium and that system is out-of-equilibrium _et cetera_. But what is equilibrium? and what is out-of-equilibrium?

We say that a system is in equilibrium if it respects time reversal symmetry (TRS) at steady state and out-of-equilibrium if it violates TRS at steady state. For example, consider the pedestrations on Champs Elysee. They clearly constitute a non-equilibrium system because if we watch the movie backwards they will appear to walk backwards.

But now suppose we pay half the people 5€ each to walk backwards. They now become an equilibrium system because if we watch the movie backwards they look exactly the same

## Active field theories

For example, non-equilibrium Cahn-Hiliard equation can give rise to a perpetual boiling droplet.
