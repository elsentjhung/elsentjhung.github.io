Current research interests: time reversal symmetry breaking in statistical field theory, active droplets, chiral liquid crystals, glasses, _etc_.

I use lattice Boltzmann simulation for fluid dynamics.

## Active field theories

For example, non-equilibrium Cahn-Hiliard equation can give rise to a perpetual boiling droplet.
