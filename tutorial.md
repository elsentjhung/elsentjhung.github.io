This tutorial is aimed at PhD students who are going to do research in Theoretical Soft Condensed Matter Physics and Statistical Physics.
(This page is work in progress and will be updated periodically.)

### 0. Programming languages

You should learn at least 1 programming language at a minimum. 
Ideally you should know 2 programming languages: 1) one high level programming language (_e.g._ Python) and 2) one low level programming language (_e.g._ C or C++).

#### 0.1. Python

The first programming language I recommend to learn is Python. The reason is that Python is a modern object-oriented programming language and widely used in scientific research and other industry such as data science, banking, machine learning, web development, _etc_. Python also has a vast library to do some numerical computation and plotting. The book I recommend to learn Python is [Eric Matthes, Python Crash Course, _No Starch Press_] (available on Amazon).

#### 0.2. C

After you become expert in Python, I would also encourage you to learn low level programming such as C or C++.
There are two reasons why this is a good idea. 
First, programs written in C usually run 10 times faster compared to those written in Python.
Second, learning low level programming language will also teach you how memory management works in your computer.
I used this book to learn C: [Greg Perry, C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide, _Que Publishing_] (also available on Amazon).

### 1. Cahn-Hilliard equation

Cahn-Hilliard equation is a model for phase-separation in a fluid, _e.g._ water/oil phase separation, liquid/gas phase separation, droplets, and so on.

#### 1.1. Coarsening process 

In this tutorial, we will give you the basic introduction to the Cahn-Hiliard equation. First we introduce the order parameter, the free energy and the time evolution of the order parameter. We will also look at the equilibrium phase diagram and the linear stability analysis of the homogenous phase. The link to the jupyter notebook is here [coarsening notebook].
