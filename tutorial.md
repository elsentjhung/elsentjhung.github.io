__1. Cahn-Hilliard equation__

Cahn-Hilliard equation is a model for phase-separation in a fluid, _e.g_ water/oil phase separation, liquid/gas phase separation, _etc_.

1.1 [Coarsening process]. In this tutorial, we will give the basic introduction to the Cahn-Hiliard equation, including equilibrium phase diagram and the linear stability analysis of the homogenous phase. 

1.2 Droplet. (Work in progress)
