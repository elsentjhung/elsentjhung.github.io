### 1. Cahn-Hilliard equation

Cahn-Hilliard equation is a model for phase-separation in a fluid, _e.g._ water/oil phase separation, liquid/gas phase separation, droplets, and so on.

#### 1.1. Coarsening process 

In this tutorial, we will give you the basic introduction to the Cahn-Hiliard equation. First we introduce the order parameter, the free energy and the time evolution of the order parameter. We will also look at the equilibrium phase diagram and the linear stability analysis of the homogenous phase. The link to the jupyter notebook is here [coarsening process].
