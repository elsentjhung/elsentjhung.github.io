I participated in the [IHPCSS 2019](http://www.ihpcss.org/) that took place in RIKEN Centre, Kobe, Japan on July 7 - 12. The main purpose of the summer school was to familiarize students with major state-of-the-art aspects of HPC for a variety of scientific disciplines, catalyze the formation of networks, provide advanced mentoring and facilitate international exchange. One of the activities was to present your own research to other 80 participants, mostly PhD students and Postdocs, from Canada, USA, Europe and Japan.

The presentation included 1-minute talk and 1-hour electronic poster session, where you stand near your laptop and show short series of ppt slides. In my one-minute talk, I introduced myself and described the main research problems of our lab. During the poster session I presented my own work - **Defining conformational states of proteins using dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms**.
