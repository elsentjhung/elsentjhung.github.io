The [UTM Graduate Research Colloquium](https://secure.utm.utoronto.ca/grc-2018/home) aims to highlight graduate student research across our campus. This special two-day event provided the opportunity for graduate students to showcase their work to fellow graduate students, post-docs, and faculty from all graduate departments.
