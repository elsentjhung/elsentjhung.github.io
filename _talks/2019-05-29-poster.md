The Biophysical Society of Canada annual meeting offers attendees the opportunity to learn about exciting new developments in Biophysics research and to network with peers from across Canada and further afield. [More information here](http://meetings.biophysicalsociety.ca/)

I presented a poster **Defining conformational states of proteins using dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms** - the same one from the BPS 2019.
